DatabaseCounters
================

Adds two database counters to the log for a request:

 - total number of requests that were made
 - total number of rows that were returned


Example
=======

Enabling in a Controller:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        database_counters :on
        # ...
    end

Will result in log output like so:

    Completed in 847ms (View: 0, DB: 5 Calls: 92 Rows: 671) | 200 OK [http://localhost/]

Or, in older (< 2.2) versions of Rails:

    Completed in 0.05835 (17 reqs/sec) | Rendering: 0.00007 (0%) | DB: 0.00265 (4%) Calls: 5 Rows: 6 | 200 OK [http://localhost/]
